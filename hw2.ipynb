Also I though the old English style might generate some interesting and fun results by stringing words together in ways that are unconventional today.

The KJV beam search tended to produce a wider variety of outputs across the beam search algorithm temperature sweep. That is to say that the HP beam search tended to have a higher repetition. Thinking about it, maybe this is due to a difference in unique word count. The number of chars for each set is about the same (~80ish) but the unique word count may be different. This would mean that a letter in the KJV bible (e.g. 'a') would have more options for following chars and so a wider distributed output.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. What new difficulties did you run into while training?\n",
        "\n",
        "Besides the fact that I had to rewrite some of the components to make them compatible with full words instead of chars, I am having difficult getting my model accuracy above ~15%. Other than that I haven't encountered too many difficulties. The vocabulary parsing was straight forward and there was some fun mods regarding missing keys in dicts, but the logistics were fine.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How large was your vocabulary?\n",
        "\n",
        "~ 12000 unique words. This is paring down from ~60000 words that the book actually has based on the recommendation of removing words with fewer than 5 occurences in the text from the vocabulary.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Did you find that different batch size, sequence length, and feature size and other hyperparameters were needed? If so, what worked best for you\n",
        "\n",
        "I trained for 10 epochs using the same settings as before for chars. Using this question as a hint, I modified the sequence length first, doubling it to 200. The thought was that because the vocab is much, much larger than the char vocab that the model might need to see more units in a row to get a better feel for the words. Before we had ~30 unique chars and sequence length of 100, now we've got ~10000 unique words and only 200 sequence length. I imagine that having the sequence length be an order of magnitude larger than the vocab size might be useful so that there's a high chance of getting non-correlated data in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next I increased batch size from 256->512. I didn't expect this to make a difference. If I understand this correctly, this just helps the SGD move faster since we've got more data points. In an epoch, we'll eventually use all the data so a batch size increase means we chug through those data points faster, but eventually we'll get all the same gradient information (I think).\n",
        "\n",
        "Next I double the feature size of the network. If I can't load more data in a sequence, maybe I can just extract more features out of that data. Of course this makes all previous weights for a 512 sized network useless so the training essentially begins again. That's OK because it only take ~10 epochs to stabilize for the standard settings. I ran this new larger network for 10 epochs and it seems to have stabilized at around the same accuracy as the smaller network. This seems to indicate we have insufficient data since we can't extract deeper features using the same style of network.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "What I find most interesting is that even though the words model and chars models are both at the same *technical* accuracy, the words model *feels* more accurate. I think this is because my brain can piece together a series of incoherent words a lot better than a series of incoherent letters. I think there's something to be exploited here. We don't have to have perfect AI to have good results when our wetware can fill in the gaps for the AI. But that's just my humble opinion...\n",
